## Git vs. GitHub
If you are new cooding or Git and Github, you may be wondering what the difference is.   

**Git**  
Git should be thought of as a private working space. In Git you save _"snapshots"_ of code, 
while working on your _local remote_. This means that you can make changes in the repositories
(_files_). 

**Github**  
Github is a "_cloud_" that can be used when working on a group project. It's a service where you can collaborate on code. It also makes it a lot easier to see the changes that other people have made and see the history of the code. You don't have to be collaborating on a project to use Github, you can also just use it to _fork_ and _clone_ other people's code, which we will get into later, or just have a backup of your own local repositories. 

So to sum it up; the differnce between Github and Git is that Git is a workspace whereas Github is a storage place where you can view the history of some code, get access to other people's code and keep track of your own.
